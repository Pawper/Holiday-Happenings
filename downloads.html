          <p>A 25 day community collaboration of holiday gaming joy for those in need.</p>
          <p>The holidays can be a rough experience for many folks who do not have good relationships with their families. The reality for a lot of people, especially LGBTQ+ folks, is that if they do not have holiday plans with friends, they do not have any holiday plans. Unfortunately, too many times the healthy choice is to not join family gatherings that stress you out.</p>
          <p>This project is dedicated to you and your new gaming friends, uniting for some TTRPG magic and bringing holiday cheer to those who need it most.</p>
